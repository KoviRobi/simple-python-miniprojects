## Description
A compilation of some simple programming exercises to help people get started
with mini-projects.

### Mini-projects
- ROT-13 decored (simple string manipulation)
- Morse-code decoder (string tokenization/splitting)
- Number parser
- Calculator language 1 (bringing it together)
  This implements a simple calculator language, with left-to-right precedence,
  not BODMAS
- Calculator language 2 (tree-like data)
  This does BODMAS

### Getting started
1. Install the development dependencies, e.g.

   ```console
   python -m venv .venv
   # For Linux
   ./.venv/bin/activate
   # For Windows/Powershell
   ./.venv/bin/Activate.ps1
   pip install -e .[dev]
   ```

2. Run the tests, see them fail, fix the failures
3. Profit
