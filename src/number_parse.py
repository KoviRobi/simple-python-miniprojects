"""
Implement number parsing -- this is of course something that is implemented in
python, so you could just read the docs and find out what function to call --
but for extra challenge you could implement it in a character-by-character way.
This will make you think about how numbers are written. To get you started,
consider e.g. "123", think about what each digit means, in each position.

That is it has a "1" in the 100s place, "2" in the 10s place and "3" in the 1s
place. If you bring it together you get "1 * 100 + 2 * 10 + 3 * 1 = 123".
